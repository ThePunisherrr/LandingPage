         <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back when I was a child I used to play all the time 
	outside with my cousins. We like to play the filipino games called tumbang preso, luksung baka and many more. 
	I always go out at the afternoon to play and go home at night. I only took kinder 1 and kinder 2 in preschool in our school 
	called D’Paul Kiddie Center Located at Malinao Pasig City. After that I got straight to grade 1 in which I took a test and 
	I passed in the test. I gained many new friends in gradeschool. I studied at Pasig Catholic College up until grade 6 in which 
	I gained new friends to interact with. It was a rollercoaster journey for me because it was not easy studying as I always fail 
	in the mathematics subject. I always have pocket food when I was studying and my food was always rice and three pieces of Jumbo 
	hotdog by Tender Juicy. Sometime when I’m tired of eating just hotdog, I buy french fries downstairs at the canteen So that I can 
	eat the hotdog with a twist. I also love to buy Real Leaf Iced Tea because it is a very sweet ice tea. It sometimes has an event 
	like starbucks where you gather coupons for you to exchange free items like pins, planners, cap, pencil case and more. The real leaf 
	iced tea was a product of the coca cola company thats why all of the free items have a coca cola sign. I gained that time three planners
	and I gave the extra ones to my childhood friends. When it was vacation time it was traditional for my fathers friends that we and them 
	have an outing outside of town like places in Laguna. We always go there to have swimming vacation and it was so much fun swimming with 
	my childhood friends.  Since grade 1 we always have this dance called ground demo every foundation week which was in february.We always have
	a ground demonstration from all the levels in school from preschool to college level and each grade have their own unique category. 
	I experienced dancing in front of many people and at first it was very nervous because Im not the of person who can dance in front of 
	many people. I’m a shy person but as I grow older I get used to it because every year we dance in front of our 
	parents and friends and it takes a long time of preparation for our dance.</blockquote></p>

          <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back when I was in my teenage years it was fun and memorable.
	At first there was adjustments but it was manageable. I also gained new friends which we had a bond. My advisor at that time was my 
	favorite because my advisor was good and easy to get along with. As usual, I always fail at the math subject because I'm a slow picker 
	but not totally fail its only pasang awa. During my grade 7 days my pot lock food was only rice because I buy at school my viand. 
	I always enjoy eating because it makes me happy. We also have this educational field trip where we go to different places like the 
	gardenia bread factory, museums, paradise adventure camp and many more.There was this one field trip that I cant forget when I was in 
	grade 12 because it was so much fun hiking together with my friends. I also enjoy being an athlete because I joined the pep squad of 
	our school in grade 10 to grade 12. At first it was hard because I can't do what they ask me to do. I was not strong at that time because
	I was a beginner but as time passes by my body is getting in condition. We had practices during wednesday, thursday and saturday. It was
	so much fun meeting them because they are friends that you can call family. Up until now I'm still friends with some of them because the
	others already migrated to another country and others are always busy.It was fun being an athlete because it has benefits in which you
	are exempted at the pe subject. During in our senior high school year we became close to our pe teacher and during that time he gathered
	student who are willing to be a dancer at the ground demonstration. At first it was us dancers who practiced early and memorized the step
	s of the dance. Later on when we are ready we tought our classmates the steps of the dance in order to prepare for the ground demo. It was
	fun dancing because all our hard work paid off and it was a success during the 3 batches of our grade level.</blockquote></p>

		<p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am Zach Emmañuelle Valdez Martin and I live in Palatiw, 
	Pasig City located at Metro Manila. I stopped a year because for me online class was not for me and it was hard to learn in an online 
	setup. During the time that I stopped I worked at the business of our family. It was a water refilling station in which I washed the 
	containers and fill them up with water after washing. I started working at 8am and ended the shift at 5pm. It was nice working because 
	after working I get my salary for the day. Having the salary that I worked for is fun because I can buy/eat anything I want. A year 
	passed by and I worked on my papers to get into the University of the East. At first it was hard because in college you meet new people 
	around you. At first it was hard because I'm a shy person but then later on I was getting used to it. I was not shy anymore with my 
	classmates because as time passed by we get to know each other. Having a group activity is an example of getting to know each other and 
	we can also see the weaknesses of each other. We help each other surpass our limits because we don't want anyone to fail in our class. 
	It was a bumpy ride because at first we don't have any backgrounds towards programming well some of us have already. We did our best and
	we passed our subjects and we moved on towards our second year in college. Our second year 1st semester was still online because it was 
	not still hard to act or go to class. It was easy because we dont have to wake up early to travel to school. Some of us lived far from 
	the school thats why we tend to leave early to avoid the traffic. Our second semester is Face to face thats why its hard for us because 
	we can't get enough rest after school. It is a nice experience because finally I can experience going to school in college because I 
	started my college life in an online setup that's why it was not that good experience for me. I also joined the UE Pep Squad because I 
	miss being an athlete and I just wanna try again being an athlete.</blockquote></p>
