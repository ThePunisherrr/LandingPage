		<h2>Skills</h2>

         <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		 In terms of skills, I can lift people up because I was once an athlete of a Pep squad or cheering squad. I can also do tumblings which 
		are required when joining the cheering squad. I’m also a hardworking person because even though hardship comes I can overcome it by being 
		patient and believing in myself. I can also work with anyone because in terms of communication I don’t have any problems. Through the years
		of communicating with other people I have learned the best way to communicate with them. I also know how to ride a bike. I go to different
		places around manila using my bike. I’m good at playing video games such as Gta V, League of Legends, War Thunder and many more. I’m also 
		good at adapting to different environments. I also have a skill that makes people wonder because I’m always smiling whenever they see me.</blockquote></p>

		<h2 id="Teen">Hobbies</h2>
          <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		When it comes to hobbies, I love to play computer games and watch movies or series. I also love to build Gunpla or Gundam figurines 
		which require a lot of patience and money when building it. I enjoy doing this hobby because it makes me forget all the hardships I’ve 
		been through. I mostly watch movies that are within my interests like racing movies, actions and many more. I also watch Korean Dramas 
		because it is fun to watch K-Dramas. When it comes to Gundams which came from an anime series I like to watch the series of the ones that 
		I have. I currently have 13 Gundams or gunplas. I love looking at my Gunplas because it is therapeutic for me. I also love to look at 
		cars especially cars that have a good sound and good look. I also like to eat different foods.</blockquote></p>

		<h2 id="College">Interests</h2>

		I also love to play in timezone in which there is a racing simulator. I’m also interested in the history of world war vehicles. 
		I’m interested in cars in the jdm type. I like the ones mostly from japan. I’m always interested whenever someone talks about cars.
