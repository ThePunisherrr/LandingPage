		<h2>Eiffel Tower</h2>
		<br>
		<p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The symbol of Paris, the Eiffel Tower is a feat of ingenuity as much as it is a 
		famous landmark. This structure of 8,000 metallic parts was designed by Gustave Eiffel as a temporary exhibit for the World Fair of 1889. Originally loathed 
		by critics, the 320-meter-high tower is now a beloved and irreplaceable fixture of the Paris skyline.
		</blockquote></p>
		<br>
		<p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he Eiffel Tower's gracefulness has earned it the nickname of "Iron Lady." Visitors 
		are impressed by the tower's delicate airiness despite its monumental size and the breathtaking panoramas at each of the three levels.
		</blockquote></p>
		<br>
		<p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tourists can dine with a view at the first level or indulge at the Michelin-starred 
		Le Jules Verne restaurant on the second level. At the exhilarating height of 276 meters, the top level offers a sweeping outlook over the city of Paris and beyond. 
		Vistas extend as far as 70 kilometers on a clear day.

		dating to the 12th and 13th centuries. Covering 2,500 square meters, the brilliant stained-glass windows allow colorful light to filter into the vast nave, 
		creating an ethereal effect. The intricately detailed windows reveal the incredible craftsmanship in depicting biblical stories.

		<h2>Musée du Louvre</h2>
		<br>
		<p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a stately palace that was once a royal residence, the Louvre Museum ranks among the 
		top European collections of fine arts. Many of Western Civilization's most famous works are found here, including the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci, the Wedding 
		Feast at Cana by Veronese, and the 1st-century-BC Venus de Milo sculpture.
		</blockquote></p>
		<br>
		<p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The collection owes its wealth to the contributions of various kings who lived in the 
		Louvre. Other pieces were added as a result of France's treaties with the Vatican and the Republic of Venice, and from the spoils of Napoléon I.
		</blockquote></p>
		<br>
		<p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Louvre displays around 35,000 artworks, including countless masterpieces. It's 
		impossible to see it all in a day or even in a week. Take a private guided tour or focus on a shortlist of key artworks for the most rewarding experience.
